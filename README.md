# Face Detection and Tracking using Custom CNN Model with TensorFlow

This repository contains a custom CNN model implemented with TensorFlow for face detection and tracking in images and videos.
## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to detect and track faces in images and videos using a custom CNN model. The model was trained on the FACE dataset The model was trained to detect faces in various sizes, orientations, and lighting conditions.
## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have TensorFlow installed. You can install TensorFlow by following the instructions on the official TensorFlow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/install.

Once TensorFlow is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Face_Detection-Tracking_CustomModel_CNN_TF.git
```
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to implement a custom CNN model for face detection and tracking using TensorFlow. The model achieves competitive performance on the FACE dataset and can be used to detect faces in images and videos.
